### Dev note corner
This made by 16 years old sole game developer, It's me!\
Hi, I'm Mario F. Shadow, or you can call me F. I made this because I also using low-end devices.\
I bet you didn't expect that this framework develop from 10-years-old 2 Ghz cpu with 8 GB ram.\
I also making a game called [BEAT//BREAK](https://mario-f-shadow.itch.io/i-obviously-addicted-to-anime-shit-or-smt), which is fully using this framework.\
I don't know that will it work since all I know is printf and things but I'll do my best and always keep doing my best.

I also know that this corner is unprofessional but whatever, All I want to do is share things to everyone.
